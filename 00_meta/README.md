# Human Airway Smooth Muscle (HASM) Transcriptome Changes in Response to Asthma Medications

## Project Summary

**Rationale:**  
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease. The most common medications used for its treatment are β2-agonists and glucocorticosteroids, and one of the primary tissues that these drugs target in the treatment of asthma is the airway smooth muscle. We used RNA-Seq to characterize the human airway smooth muscle (HASM) transcriptome at baseline and under three asthma treatment conditions.

**Methods:**  
The Illumina TruSeq assay was used to prepare 75 bp paired-end libraries for HASM cells from four white male donors under four treatment conditions:

1. No treatment (untreated)  
2. β2-agonist (Albuterol, 1 μM for 18h)  
3. Glucocorticosteroid (Dexamethasone, 1 μM for 18h)  
4. Simultaneous treatment with Albuterol and Dexamethasone  

Libraries were sequenced with an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 instrument. The Tuxedo Suite Tools were used for alignment, assembly, and differential expression analysis.

## Overall Design

mRNA profiles were obtained via RNA-Seq for four primary human airway smooth muscle cell lines under the four treatment conditions described above.
